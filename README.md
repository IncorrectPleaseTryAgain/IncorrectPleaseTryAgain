<summary><h3>🗺️ Journey</h3></summary>
⭐
I am currently perusing a bachelor's degree in computer science; however, I am also in the process of teaching myself different programming languages as well as some libraries. I started by learning Cpp in my first year of university but then I started branching out to other programming languages such as JavaScript, HTML and CSS. My journey has not been as long or adventurous as others, nevertheless I am more motivated to program and eager to learn new programming languages and programming concepts. 
  
My journey started when I was around 12yrs old, my dad had a computer with the programming software <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> on it. This is where I used to look at my brother program different games, however, I never seemed to interested in programming myself. Skip to high-school and this is where my passion for programming realy started to take off. I wrote my first program in grade 11 because this was the only year my school gave us the opportunity to take a programming course. This course was in python and mainly dealt with <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/turtle-programming-python/">turle programming</a>. Fast-forward to grade 12 and I, for some unknown reason, decided to persue a degree in computer science.
  
I first joined the University of Regina in September of 2020, and this is where I complete my first year of programming. I was taught about OOP and data structures and algorithms, all the while using Cpp. I finished my first year but for some reason I decided to switch universities to an online university that is based in the US. Needless to say this was a big mistake, yes I learned some more Cpp as well as python and Javal however, the university's standard was too low for my liking and I wasn't chanllenged enough. I completed about a year and a half at that university before deciding to switch universties again.
